                <br>

                <p><b>THINK</b> Could this be a scam?</p>
                <li>You could be taken to a fake website</li>
                <li>You could be tricked into giving away your personal information</li>

                <br>
                <p>A scam is when someone tries to take your money by pretending to help you, or by offering you something which they are not going to give you. It can be difficult to tell if something is a scam, or if it is real.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p><b>REMEMBER</b></p>
                <li>Your bank will never ask you to transfer your money to a ‘safe’ account.</li>
                <li>Only criminals will try to rush and panic you into taking money out of your account, moving it to a different account, or sharing your information.</li>
                <li>Do not send money to a person you have never met in real life.</li>
                <br>

                <p><b>RESPOND</b></p>
                <li>Do you need to click on this link?</li>
                <li>Does the link take you to the website you expected?</li>
                <li>Are there any typos in the link?</li>
